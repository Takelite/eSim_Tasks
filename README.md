# Task 1: SPICE Model Converter
## Objective
Write a Python script to convert SPICE model files from the IHP PDK into a format compatible with eSim.
## Instructions
Study the structure of SPICE model files provided in the IHP PDK.
Understand eSim's model definition format (refer to eSim documentation).
Develop a Python script that:
Reads a SPICE model file.
Parses key parameters (e.g., transistor models, capacitances).
Generates an equivalent model definition file for eSim.
Test the script with at least two different SPICE models and verify the output.
Skills Tested
File parsing and data extraction in Python.
Understanding of SPICE and eSim model formats.
Attention to detail in parameter mapping.
Deliverables
Python script (.py file) with comments explaining the conversion logic.
Sample SPICE model files and their corresponding eSim model files.
Brief report (.pdf or .docx) on the conversion process and any challenges faced.
Resources
eSim Documentation - Model definitions.
Python File Handling.
SPICE model files (provided by the team or from the IHP PDK).







Task 2: Symbol Library Generator
Objective
Develop a Python script to generate symbol libraries for eSim based on IHP PDK component definitions.
Instructions
Obtain component definitions from the IHP PDK (e.g., from a database or file).
Study eSim's symbol file format.
Create a Python script that:
Reads component descriptions.
Generates symbol files (.sym) for each component.
Ensures symbols are correctly formatted for eSim's schematic editor.
Test the generated symbols by importing them into eSim.
Skills Tested
File generation and formatting in Python.
Understanding of schematic symbols in EDA tools.
Attention to graphical and functional accuracy.
Deliverables
Python script (.py file) for symbol generation.
Generated symbol files (.sym) for at least three components.
Screenshots showing the symbols loaded in eSim.
Resources
IHP PDK Component Definitions (provided by the team).
eSim Symbol Creation Guide.
Python String Formatting.







Task 3: Simulation Automation Tool
Objective
Implement a Python-based tool to automate simulation setups in eSim using IHP PDK models.
Instructions
Learn how simulations are configured in eSim.
Design a Python script that:
Takes user inputs for circuit design and simulation parameters.
Generates simulation scripts or configuration files.
Optionally, runs the simulation and extracts results.
Test the tool with a simple circuit using IHP PDK models.

     Skills Tested
Automation and scripting in Python.
Familiarity with simulation workflows in eSim.
Integration of external tools via Python.
Deliverables
Python tool (.py file) with user-friendly inputs.
Sample simulation configuration files generated by the tool.
Report (.pdf or .docx) on how to use the tool and its benefits.
Resources
eSim Simulation Tutorial.
Python Subprocess Module for running external commands.
IHP PDK Models (provided by the team).
